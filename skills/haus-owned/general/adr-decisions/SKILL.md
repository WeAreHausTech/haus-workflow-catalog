  Draft and gate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) when changes are decision-worthy.
  Use when `haus decisions suggest` fires, when adding deps/schema/auth/API changes,
  or when the user asks why a choice was made. Machine drafts; human approves.

# ADR decisions

Captures **why** significant choices were made under `docs/decisions/`.

## Use when

- `haus decisions suggest` or the Stop hook proposes an ADR
- A change touches dependencies, schema, auth, public APIs, CI, or infrastructure
- The user asks "why did we choose X?" before coding an alternative

## Workflow

1. Run `haus decisions suggest` (or use the Stop-hook JSON draft).
2. Present the draft to the user — **never** mark `Accepted` without explicit approval.
3. On approval: write `docs/decisions/NNNN-slug.md` and add a README index row with a one-line **why**.
4. Commit the ADR in the same PR as the code change.

## Do not

- Hand-author ADRs without pulling context from the diff and conversation
- Skip the README index update
- Use `[adr-skip]` for security/auth path changes (gate ignores skip)

## Commands

```bash
haus decisions suggest          # draft from staged/unstaged diff
haus decisions check --staged   # local gate
haus decisions next-number      # next NNNN
haus decisions validate path    # structure check
```

Index lives at `docs/decisions/README.md` — keep it `@import`ed from `CLAUDE.md`.
